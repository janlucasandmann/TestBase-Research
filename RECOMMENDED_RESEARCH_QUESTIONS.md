- **Mutations Available**: ~200+ expected mutations
- **Study ID**: `luad_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`
- **Why this is excellent**: KRAS is highly mutated in lung cancer and drives oncogenesis

### 5. Which regulatory elements are altered by APC mutations in colorectal cancer?
- **Gene**: APC
- **Cancer Type**: Colorectal cancer
- **Mutations Available**: ~300+ expected mutations
- **Study ID**: `coadread_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`

---

## ðŸŸ¢ **GOOD PRIORITY** (50+ mutations available)

### 6. How do PTEN mutations affect enhancer landscapes in breast cancer?
- **Gene**: PTEN
- **Cancer Type**: Breast cancer
- **Mutations Available**: 64 mutations in TCGA dataset
- **Study ID**: `brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`
- **Why this is good**: PTEN is a key tumor suppressor with known regulatory roles

### 7. What splicing networks are disrupted by BRCA1 mutations?
- **Gene**: BRCA1
- **Cancer Type**: Breast cancer
- **Mutations Available**: 27 mutations in TCGA dataset
- **Study ID**: `brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`
- **Why this is good**: BRCA1 has important regulatory functions beyond DNA repair

## ðŸ”¬ **Implementation Recommendations**

### **Start with #1 or #2** for maximum impact:
- Both PIK3CA and TP53 have 300+ mutations available
- Breast cancer data is well-curated in TCGA
- These genes have known regulatory importance

### **Perfect for AlphaGenome analysis**:
- All questions focus on **regulatory mechanisms** (not just coding effects)
- Questions target **tissue-specific effects** (perfect for AlphaGenome's capabilities)
- Rich variant data ensures robust statistical analysis

### **Next Steps**:
1. **Choose PIK3CA in breast cancer** (387 mutations - highest data availability)
2. **Adapt the MGMT pipeline** for PIK3CA analysis
3. **Focus on enhancer discovery** (PIK3CA mutations likely create new regulatory elements)
4. **Compare tissue specificity** (breast vs other tissues)

## ðŸ“Š **Why These Questions Work Better Than MGMT**

| Gene | Cancer | Mutations | vs MGMT |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **PIK3CA** | Breast | **387** | 387x more data |
| **TP53** | Breast | **353** | 353x more data |  
| **GATA3** | Breast | **130** | 130x more data |
| MGMT | Glioblastoma | 1 | Baseline |

**The data availability difference is dramatic** - we'll have hundreds of variants to analyze instead of just 1!

## ðŸš€ **Recommended Next Action**

**Use PIK3CA in breast cancer** as our next research question:
- Modify `mgmt_research_analysis.py` â†’ `pik3ca_research_analysis.py`
- Change study ID to `brca_tcga_pan_can_atlas_2018`
- Focus on breast tissue specificity
- Analyze how PIK3CA mutations create enhancers that drive breast cancer

This will demonstrate the full power of our real clinical data pipeline with abundant variant data!
