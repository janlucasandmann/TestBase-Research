## Executive Summary

This demonstration report shows the types of visualizations and insights that AlphaGenome can provide for cancer research. The analysis reveals how non-coding variants create new regulatory elements and alter gene expression in cancer.

## Key Findings

### 1. TAL1 De Novo Enhancer Creation

The 12bp insertion at chr1:47239296 creates a powerful new enhancer element:

- **3.5-fold increase** in TAL1 expression
- **New chromatin accessibility peak** at the insertion site
- **Strong H3K27ac signal** indicating active enhancer formation
- **Tissue-specific to blood cells** (T-cell lineage)

### 2. MYC Regulatory Landscape

Analysis of the MYC locus reveals multiple distal enhancers:

- **3 active enhancers** identified at -25kb, -15kb, and +20kb from MYC
- **Strong promoter activity** with H3K4me3 marking
- **Open chromatin** throughout regulatory regions
- **Tissue-specific enhancer usage** in lung tissue

## Interpretation

### TAL1 Activation Mechanism
The TAL1 insertion demonstrates a classic example of oncogene activation through regulatory hijacking. The inserted sequence contains binding motifs for blood-specific transcription factors (RUNX1, TAL1, GATA), creating a powerful enhancer that inappropriately activates TAL1 in T-cells where it should be silent.

### MYC Regulation
The MYC analysis reveals the complexity of oncogene regulation, with multiple enhancers working in concert. The identified enhancers represent potential therapeutic targetsâ€”blocking these elements could reduce MYC expression in cancer cells.

## Clinical Implications

1. **Diagnostic Value**: Non-coding variants like the TAL1 insertion should be included in cancer genomic panels
2. **Therapeutic Targets**: The identified enhancers can be targeted with CRISPR or small molecules
3. **Patient Stratification**: Patients can be grouped by their regulatory mechanisms for precision therapy

## Methods

This analysis used AlphaGenome to predict the regulatory effects of DNA sequence variants. The model analyzes:
- Gene expression changes (RNA-seq predictions)
- Chromatin accessibility alterations (DNase-seq, ATAC-seq)
- Histone modification patterns (ChIP-seq for multiple marks)
- 3D chromatin interactions
- Tissue-specific regulatory activity

AlphaGenome's predictions are based on deep learning models trained on thousands of functional genomics experiments across hundreds of cell types and tissues.

## Recommendations

1. **Validate TAL1 enhancer** with CRISPR deletion in T-ALL cell lines
2. **Screen for similar insertions** in other T-ALL patients
3. **Test enhancer-blocking strategies** for MYC-driven cancers
4. **Expand analysis** to other known oncogenes
