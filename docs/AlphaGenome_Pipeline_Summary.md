# AlphaGenome Cancer Research Pipeline - Summary

## Overview

This pipeline leverages AlphaGenome to discover novel regulatory mechanisms in cancer, focusing on the 98% non-coding genome.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. De Novo Enhancer Discovery
- Identifies variants that create new regulatory elements
- Predicts tissue-specific enhancer activity
- Maps affected target genes

### 2. Regulatory Landscape Mapping
- Complete view of all regulatory elements controlling a gene
- Identifies distal enhancers up to 1Mb away
- Tissue-specific regulatory patterns

### 3. Tissue Specificity Analysis
- Explains why variants cause cancer in specific tissues
- Compares effects across multiple tissue types
- Identifies tissue-specific vulnerabilities

### 4. Long-Range Interaction Analysis
- Maps 3D chromatin contacts
- Identifies enhancer hijacking events
- Discovers TAD boundary disruptions

### 5. Splicing Dysregulation Prediction
- Predicts splice site changes
- Identifies exon skipping events
- Maps isoform switching

## Generated Outputs

### Visualizations
- `visualizations/` - Multi-track plots showing variant impacts
- Reference vs alternate allele comparisons
- Chromatin state changes
- Gene expression alterations

### Reports
- `reports/` - Comprehensive markdown reports
- Embedded visualizations
- Clinical interpretations
- Therapeutic recommendations

### Data Files
- Analysis results in JSON format
- Processed variant data
- Prediction outputs

## Usage

```python
from alphagenome_cancer_pipeline import AlphaGenomeCancerPipeline, RegulatoryVariant

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = AlphaGenomeCancerPipeline(api_key="YOUR_KEY")

# Analyze a variant
variant = RegulatoryVariant(
    chromosome="chr1",
    position=12345678,
    ref="A",
    alt="G",
    variant_id="my_variant"
)

# Run analysis
results = pipeline.compare_tissue_specificity(
    variant=variant,
    tissues=["lung", "liver", "brain"]
)
```

## Next Steps

1. Validate predictions experimentally
2. Screen patient cohorts for similar variants
3. Design therapeutic strategies targeting identified enhancers
4. Expand to additional cancer types and genes
