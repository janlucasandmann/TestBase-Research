## Interpretation

This analysis mapped all regulatory elements controlling the target gene. Key findings include the identification of distal enhancers and their tissue-specific activity patterns. These elements represent potential therapeutic targets for modulating gene expression.

## Methods

This analysis was performed using AlphaGenome, a deep learning model that predicts the effects of DNA sequence variants on gene expression and chromatin state. The model analyzes sequences up to 1Mb in length and provides predictions for:

- Gene expression (RNA-seq)
- Chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq, ATAC-seq)
- Histone modifications (ChIP-seq)
- Transcription factor binding
- Splicing patterns
- 3D chromatin interactions
