## Tissue Specificity Analysis

**Variant**: Jurkat_TAL1_insertion
**Location**: chr1:47239296
**Most Affected Tissue**: blood
**Tissue-Specific**: No

### Tissue Effects

| Tissue | Regulatory Impact | Chromatin Change | Top Gene |
|--------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| blood | 0.000 | 0.000 | None |
| brain | 0.000 | 0.000 | None |
| lung | 0.000 | 0.000 | None |
| liver | 0.000 | 0.000 | None |

## Interpretation

This analysis reveals why certain variants drive cancer in specific tissues. Tissue-specific effects often depend on the presence of particular transcription factors and chromatin states unique to each cell type.

## Methods

This analysis was performed using AlphaGenome, a deep learning model that predicts the effects of DNA sequence variants on gene expression and chromatin state. The model analyzes sequences up to 1Mb in length and provides predictions for:

- Gene expression (RNA-seq)
- Chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq, ATAC-seq)
- Histone modifications (ChIP-seq)
- Transcription factor binding
- Splicing patterns
- 3D chromatin interactions
